This CFD domain will first be created and then discretized into small finite elements (2D) or finite volumes (3D). The flow field's governing equations are then solved numerically inside these finite elements or volumes via an iterative process till a converged solution inside the entire CFD domain is obtained.

    "The CFD domain for the 2D laminar flow over a rectangle is chosen to be a finite two dimensional square with sides of 20 [m] as shown in Fig. 1. The rectangle of interest, which the fluid dynamics around it needs to be simulated, is located in the center of the square with 1 [m] width and 2 [m] length. These dimensions would result into a geometrical factors of $\\frac{L}{l}=20$ and $\\frac{L}{w}10$ where $L$ is length of the CFD domain and $w$ and $l$ are rectangle's width and length respectively. These two geometrical factors would remove potential blockage effect on the simulated flow field around the rectangle. If blockage effect is a variable of interest the value of these geometrical factors can be reduced. Furthermore, the shape and dimensions of the domain are chosen such that the required number of mesh elements can be controlled and non-dimensional groups of variables (i.e. Reynolds number) can be estimated fast, while most of variables are set to be equal unity. The users can define the dimensions of the CFD domain according to their own problem definition.\n",

    "To create the geometry of the visualized CFD domain in Fig. 1, it is recommended to start with creating a rectangle with width of 1 [m] and length of 2 [m] in the center of the domain, where the origin of coordinates is located. From the origin, create a square of 20 [m] edge length, this will be the fluid domain. To be able to apply mesh size control over the domain, smaller rectangles are created. Mesh size control is important because it will improve the calculation quality over some interested region and save computational time by reduce calculation at some unnecessary area such as inlet and walls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the times it is recommended to mesh the entire domain at this stage! This might result into a preliminary meshed CFD domain, however it is highly discouraged! The general recommended methodology is discretization of the raw geometry into sub-domains with smooth interface and mesh-ability potential. As it will be showed and discussed later this method would provide the users a great level of controllability on mesh resolution, whenever it is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the raw geometry and sub-geometries of the CFD domain is created, it should be discretized into finite elements/volumes (a.k.a meshing procedure). In simple words, meshing is the process of \\\"chopping\\\" the geometry of the CFD domain into smaller finite elements and/or volumes, wherein the flow field's governing equations will be solved numerically. High quality mesh elements, with reasonable aspect ratio, would lead to a smoother and more promising numerical solution. Therefore, it is important to increase the quality and level of controllability in the CFD domain at the first step by proper meshing and topology techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rule of thumb is to have a high mesh resolution close to the rectangle area, where the flow field behavior is complex due to formation of boundary layer and decrease mesh resolution, where the flow field behavior is simple. For even more complex flow field such as turbulent boundary layer there are specific techniques and guidelines to set the mesh resolution around the rectangle's wall, which will be introduced in other case studies as needed. Using the current approach one created a well-defined CFD domain geometry with high mesh resolution close to rectangle's boundary, where the physics of the flow are more complex (i.e. boundary layer region) and gradually decreased it to bounds of the domain, where flow field is uniform and simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially a coarse mesh is applied to the whole geometry. This mesh is used for the outer region of the flow field because the flow is uniform in those region. A mesh refine feature was used to increase the mesh quality at the rectangleâ€™s surrounding geometries created in the previous step. Fig.2 shows the chosen regions to be refined meshing. Those regions will experience complex fluid-body interaction, thus they need to have fine elements to accurately calculate the flow equations. \n",

    "To create the raw geometry of the visualized CFD domain in Fig. 1, it is recommended to start with creating a rectangle with width of 1 [m] and length of 2 [m] in the center of the domain, where the origin of coordinates is located. Then with respect to the same origin, create a square of 20 [m] edge length, which will be the fluid domain. \n",
    "In majority of available tutorials users are recommended to mesh the entire domain in a one step at this stage! This might result into a quick and preliminary meshed CFD domain, however it probably lead into poor numerical results and miss-lead users in case of divergence of the simulations, hence it is highly discouraged! The recommended step is discretization of the raw geometry into sub-domains with smooth interface and high quality mesh-ability potential. To apply mesh size control over the created domain, smaller rectangular shape sub-sections are created around the central rectangle as shown in Fig. 1. Methodological mesh size control allow users to vary the quality of the mesh in any area of interest according to the computational needs and goals. For example in case of obtaining poor numerical results with the initial coarse mesh around the central rectangle, users can easily increase the mesh resolution around rectangle and re-run the simulations. Furthermore, creating the mesh size control would provide the option of creating coarse mesh in areas that the flow field is no complicated for the case study of interest such as inlet, outlet and domain walls in this case study. \n",

<<<<<<< HEAD
    "The element size chosen to refine the mesh was 25mm, which will give 80 elements along the length of the rectangle and 40 elements along the width of the rectangle. This type of distribution is not ideal since a smaller element size should be assigned so that there are more than 100 elements along the length of the rectangle. However, the results were close to the experiment data conducted by a few CFD groups, thus it is acceptable due to limitation in computer resources. It is worth noting that the two slender rectangles on the left should have been coarsely meshed, because the inlet flow is uniform, thus more calculation in those two inlet region is redundant.\n",
