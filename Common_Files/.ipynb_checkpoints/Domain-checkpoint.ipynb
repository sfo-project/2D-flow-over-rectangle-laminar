    "# CFD Domain's Creation & Discretization\n",

    "** The next step for developing the CFD simulation for a case study, after the review of physics and theory behind the problem of interest, is to create the CFD/Computational domain. This CFD domain will first be created and then discretized into small finite elements (2D) or finite volumes (3D). The flow field's governing equations are then solved numerically inside these finite elements or volumes via an iterative process till a converged solution inside the entire CFD domain is obtained. It should be highlighted that this section provides the most generic steps and techniques to create and discretize the CFD domain. Users can implement these steps/techniques in the mesher of their choice or download the pre-generated * .msh file from the \\\"Simulation_Src\\\" folder. **\n",

    "The CFD domain for the 2D laminar flow over a rectangle is chosen to be a finite two dimensional square with sides of 20 [m] as shown in Fig. 1. The rectangle is located in the center of the square with 1 [m] width and 2 [m] length. These dimensions would result into a geometrical factor of 20 and 10 between length of the CFD domain and rectangle's width and length, which guarantees removing potential issue of blockage and inaccurate flow field estimation around the rectangle. The shape and dimensions of the domain are chosen such that the required number of mesh elements can be controlled and non-dimensional groups of variables (i.e. Reynolds number) can be estimated fast, while most of variables are set to be equal unity. The users can define the dimensions of the CFD domain according to their own problem definition.\n",

    "Fig.1 - The geometry of CFD domain for the two dimensional laminar flow over a rectangle, with multiple sections for mesh control\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To create the geometry of the visualized CFD domain in Fig. 1, it is recommended to start with creating a rectangle with width of 1 [m] and length of 2 [m] in the center of the domain, where the origin of coordinates is located. From the origin, create a square of 20 [m] edge length, this will be the fluid domain. To be able to apply mesh size control over the domain, smaller rectangles are created. Mesh size control is important because it will improve the calculation quality over some interested region and save computational time by reduce calculation at some unnecessary area such as inlet and walls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the times it is recommended to mesh the entire domain at this stage! This might result into a preliminary meshed CFD domain, however it is highly discouraged! The general recommended methodology is discretization of the raw geometry into sub-domains with smooth interface and mesh-ability potential. As it will be showed and discussed later this method would provide the users a great level of controllability on mesh resolution, whenever it is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the raw geometry and sub-geometries of the CFD domain is created, it should be discretized into finite elements/volumes (a.k.a meshing procedure). In simple words, meshing is the process of \\\"chopping\\\" the geometry of the CFD domain into smaller finite elements and/or volumes, wherein the flow field's governing equations will be solved numerically. High quality mesh elements, with reasonable aspect ratio, would lead to a smoother and more promising numerical solution. Therefore, it is important to increase the quality and level of controllability in the CFD domain at the first step by proper meshing and topology techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rule of thumb is to have a high mesh resolution close to the rectangle area, where the flow field behavior is complex due to formation of boundary layer and decrease mesh resolution, where the flow field behavior is simple. For even more complex flow field such as turbulent boundary layer there are specific techniques and guidelines to set the mesh resolution around the rectangle's wall, which will be introduced in other case studies as needed. Using the current approach one created a well-defined CFD domain geometry with high mesh resolution close to rectangle's boundary, where the physics of the flow are more complex (i.e. boundary layer region) and gradually decreased it to bounds of the domain, where flow field is uniform and simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially a coarse mesh is applied to the whole geometry. This mesh is used for the outer region of the flow field because the flow is uniform in those region. A mesh refine feature was used to increase the mesh quality at the rectangleâ€™s surrounding geometries created in the previous step. Fig.2 shows the chosen regions to be refined meshing. Those regions will experience complex fluid-body interaction, thus they need to have fine elements to accurately calculate the flow equations. \n",

    "                   Fig.2: The regions chosen to refine the mesh.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The element size chosen to refine the mesh was 25mm, which will give 80 elements along the length of the rectangle and 40 elements along the width of the rectangle. This type of distribution is not ideal since a smaller element size should be assigned so that there are more than 100 elements along the length of the rectangle. However, the results were close to the experiment data conducted by a few CFD groups, thus it is acceptable due to limitation in computer resources. It is worth noting that the two slender rectangles on the left should have been coarsely meshed, because the inlet flow is uniform, thus more calculation in those two inlet region is redundant.\n",

    "                   \n",
    "As it is shown in zoom-in view of Fig. 4 and the overall view in Fig.3, the used meshing algorithm provided a high mesh resolution around the rectangle and decreases it moving farther from it. At this stage one can see that how using a set of pre-defined sub geometry helped having a structured and well-controlled mesh. Upon requirement for increasing the mesh resolution around the rectangle user can simply redefine the value of element size or element type to have a desired element distribution as well as triangle or quad mesh.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the mesh is generated it's quality should be examined. This can be done using the provided features and functions defined in the meshing software. In general these functions calculate the aspect ratio of each elements and report a statistical report on them. The goal is to keep the average aspect ratio close to 1 for a very high quality mesh. In this stage the CFD domain is completely meshed and is ready to be setup for a CFD simulation.\n",
